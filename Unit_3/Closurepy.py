'''

   A closure is a nested function which has access to a free
   variable from an enclosing function thay has finished its execution.

   Its charecterstics are : 
   - it is a nested function.
   - it has access to a free variabel in outer scope.
   - it is returned from the enclosing function.

   [A free variable is a variable that is not bound to the local scope]

   Closures with immutable variables such as numbers and strings 
   use the nonlocal keywords.
